# MCP3021 Array Breakout Board
A breakout board for four (4) I2C 10-bit analog to digital (A/D) converters. 

## Where to Buy

## What is it?
A board with four analog to digital (A/D) converters that your ESP8266 can interface with it using I2C.

## Why did you make it?
The ESP8266 is great module, but it lacks some functionality that it's often necessary to use another microcontroller to accomplish what you want. One of the features that it lacks are A/D converters (it only has one and it's hard to access if you have the ESP-01 version).
